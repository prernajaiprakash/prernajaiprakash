## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Prerna Jaiprakash, a data enthusiast with a strong passion for turning raw data into meaningful and actionable insights. With a Master's degree in Information Systems from the University of Maryland and hands-on experience in Python, SQL, R, Power BI, and Tableau, I've worked on multiple projects that drive operational efficiency and optimize business processes.

Currently, I'm a Data Analyst at SunPubs Investment Group, where I've built predictive models and interactive dashboards that help our team make smarter decisions. Before this, I honed my skills as a Data Scientist at CrowdDoing and during an internship at Latimer Ventures, diving deep into data mining, natural language processing, and advanced analytics. I love working in dynamic environments where I can use my technical skills to tackle complex challenges and contribute to the growth of the organization.
