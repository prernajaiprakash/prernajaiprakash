## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ’¬ A brief introduction about me: I am a passionate and experienced data analyst with a strong background in data extraction, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling. I hold a Master's degree in Information Systems from the University of Maryland and have hands-on experience using tools such as Python, SQL, R, Power BI, and Tableau. My professional journey includes significant roles where I employed data analytics to drive operational efficiency, optimize business processes, and deliver actionable insights.

Currently, I work as a Data Analyst at SunPubs Investment Group, where I have successfully developed predictive models and interactive dashboards to enhance decision-making processes. My previous experience as a Data Scientist at CrowdDoing and an internship at Latimer Ventures have equipped me with a comprehensive skill set in data mining, natural language processing, and statistical analysis. I thrive in fast-paced environments, leveraging my technical skills and analytical mindset to solve complex problems and contribute to organizational growth.
